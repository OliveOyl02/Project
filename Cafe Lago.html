<font face= "Bookman Old Style" color=SKYBLUE size=5><p ALIGN=JUSTIFY> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Cafe Lago is a restaurant located along the shores of Sampaloc Lake, the largest of San Pablo’s Seven Lakes. Owned by environmentalist and San Pablo local Mandy Marino, this childhood home was transformed into the charming garden restaurant.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Guests can enjoy their meals under a trellis of vines in the cafe’s refreshing outdoor courtyard. For a more scenic view, the cafe’s staff can even bring the tables out for a lakeside lunch or snack, where you can get a view of Mt. Cristobal while you dine
