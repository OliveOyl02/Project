The Isnag, also Isneg or Apayao, live at the northwesterly end of northern Luzon, in the upper half of the Cordillera 
province of Apayao. The term "Isneg" derives from itneg, meaning inhabitants of the Tineg River. Apayao derives from the
 battle cry Ma-ap-ay-ao as their hand is clapped rapidly over their mouth. They may also refer to themselves as 
if they live upstream, or Imallod if they live downstream. The municipalities in the Isneg domain include Pudtol, Kabugao,
 Calanasan, Flora, Conner, Sta. Marcela, and Luna. Two major river systems, the Abulog River and the Apayao River, run through 
Isnag country. Jars of basi are half buried in the ground within a small shed, abulor, constructed of 4 posts and a shed.
 This abulor is found within the open space, linong or sidong, below their houses (balay). They grow upland rice, while also 
practicing swidden farming, and fishing.

Say-am was an important ceremony after a successful headhunting, or other important occasions, hosted by the wealthy, and 
lasting one to five days or more. Dancing, singing, eating and drinking mark the feast, and Isnegs wear their finest clothes. 
The shaman, Anituwan, prays to the spirit Gatan, before the first dog is sacrificed, if a human head had not been taken, and 
offered at the sacred tree, ammadingan. On the last day, a coconut is split in honor of the headhunter guardian, Anglabbang.The 
Pildap is an equivalent say-am but hosted by the poor. Conversion to Christianity grew after 1920, and today, the Isnegs are 
divided in their religious beliefs, with some still being animistic.
