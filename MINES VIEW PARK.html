<BR> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspAn overlook 
on the northeastern outskirts of Baguio in the Philippines. It is five kilometers away from the Heart of Baguio, passing through 
the Botanical Garden, the Mansion House, and the Pacdal Circle.
Located on a land promontory 4 km from downtown Baguio, the park overlooks the mining town of Itogon, particularly the abandoned
 gold and copper mines] of the Benguet Corporation, and offers a glimpse of the Amburayan Valley. Wright Park,is a quiet promenade 
with a long reflecting pool lined with pine tree which is located at the eastern part of the city and fronting the main gate of the 
Mansion. Is one of the many scenic parks in Baguio City. Its main features are a shallow elongated rectangular body of water known 
as the "Pool of Pines" and the park circle which is on one end of the park. Postcard-type photographs are usually taken at both ends
 of Wright Park and when going there it is best to bring along a camera.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspTall pine trees and decorative street lights line both sides of the access road beside 
the pool. There are times that you will find at the park some Igorots dressed in their native attire and regalia who are willing 
to pose for a photograph provided they are going to be paid for it. Native handicrafts are also sold at the Mansion end of the park 
sby a few Igorot peddlers.
