<font face= "Bookman Old Style" color=SKYBLUE size=5><p ALIGN=JUSTIFY> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Casa San Pablo is a cozy country inn that features an eclectic mix of art and nature. With its sprawling garden, flowers, pine trees, and native hammocks, you’ll just want to relax the whole weekend. This quaint B&B, which was founded in 1997 by innkeepers Boots and An Mercado-Alcantara, is sought out by travellers and artists looking for a rustic environment where you can relax away from city living. No two rooms here are decorated alike, and some even display the quirky collections of the owners including matchbox cars, birdcages, museum posters, and paintings by specific artists.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp While Casa San Pablo’s cafe caters mostly to stay-in guests, day trippers can also stop by for all-day breakfast or a lunch of home-cooked Laguna specialties. They even hold native cooking classes here! Casa San Pablo is also great as an events venue for weddings, pre-nuptial pictorials, and team-building sessions.
