the classic peanut brittle! If you can, get them from Good Shepherd brand or from Baguio Paradise, as they really know how to 
make a good jar of these sweet, glassy goodness. Romana’s has a version that uses whole peanuts instead of crushed nuts. For a
 different take on the classic dessert, get the cashew brittle.
