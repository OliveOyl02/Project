A Fun way to practice spoken English is to meet new friends and accept the wonderful challenges to see a splendid scenery. If you want a more difficult and challenging mountain, Mount Ulap is best for you. It has a wide scope of mountainous views. It will take 4 to 5 hours to finish the trail and the result of your sweat and muscle pain is the beautiful scenery of the place. You can take jeepney from Baguio to Ampucao for about 40 minutes, head to the Barangay Hall of Ampucao for registration and you can now start your trek.
