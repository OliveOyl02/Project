ell a friend or a family member that you are going to Baguio, how often do they tell you to “bring home some strawberries?”
 Admit it: you hear it quite often. The famous fruit has long been associated with Baguio City because of its proximity to 
Benguet province, where the berries are grown. Strawberries however are a seasonal fruit and are abundant and cheap during the 
months of November to March. Outside this season, they may be difficult and pricey to get.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspGood thing that there other pasalubong you can buy in Baguio. So, for when you go up to the City of Pines at other times of 
the year, you can check out these other goodies and where to eat in Baguio instead.
