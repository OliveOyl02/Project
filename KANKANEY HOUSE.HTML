<font face= "Comic Sans MS" color=WHITE size=5><p ALIGN=JUSTIFY> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe Kankana-eys live in the upland areas of Benguet province and belong to the tribal group called "Igorots".   They are one of the larger tribes the region.  They are hardworking people in the field of agriculture who are already reached by modern technologies.  The Kankana-eys build rice terraces which have become sufficient sources of food.  The staple foods of the Kankana-eys are camote, rice, potatoes, and other root crops like tugi and gabi.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe marriage customs of the Kankana-eys are similar to the Ibalois.  They practice parental marriage.  A wedding is celebrated with big feasts and many rituals done before and during the wedding ceremony. Butchering of animals is a very important part of the wedding.  In the past there have been cases of intermarriages with lowland people.  But due to unfavorable experiences, this practice is already declining. The Kankana-ey families believe that husbands are the heads of the family and elders should be well-respected in the community.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe Kankana-eys are some of the best vegetable growers in the Philippines.  They are innovative in the fields and they practice proven technology like irrigation and the construction of rice terraces.  Most of their income comes from tilling the fields.  They are also into mining since the Kankana-ey territory yields lots of minerals, particularly gold.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspHunting is also practiced by the people with the use of spears and dogs, while fishing is done with the use of bamboo traps.  The Kankana-ey women are said to be the best weavers in Benguet province.  They produce sweaters, shirts and blankets.  They also produce baskets, pots and furnitures which are marketed in the city of Baguio and other nearby towns.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe Kankana-eys, having been reached by modern amenities, live in big communities and are aware of the importance of education.  Because of a high literacy rate among the group, they desire socio-economic developments such as improvement of the road from towns to villages, protection of remaining forest, and the improvement of the water system and electrification of the Kankana-ey territory.
