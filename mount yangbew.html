This mountain is located at La Trinidad Benguet. It will only take less than 40 minutes to ride a Tomay jeepney from Baguio City to La Trinidad. You can just tell the driver to drop you off at Tawang Barangay. You can walk going to Tawang Elementary school and start your climbing experience. As you reach the top of the mountain, you can see the clouds surging through the mountains. The best time to hike is 6:00 am to 7:00 am for you to see the sun rise and 5:00pm to 6:00 pm for sun set view.
