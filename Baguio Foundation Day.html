<font face= "COMIC SANS MS" color=WHITE size=5><p ALIGN=JUSTIFY> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp This summer capital of the country will commemorate its 108th founding anniversary on September 1, which will showcase the city’s accomplishments as home of champions.

The day is also declared as a special non-working holiday in the city.

Baguio Day coincides with the observance of Eid al-Adha or “The Feast of Sacrifice” which has been declared as national regular holiday.

City administrator, Lawyer Carlos Canilao, on Tuesday said the city will recognize the men and women who have excelled in various fields like sports, arts, profession, pageants, excellent public servants and even its outstanding citizens.

“We are recognizing the excellent performance of our people,” as a theme for this year’s charter day “Baguio @108: Land of Champions,” he said.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspLeading the awardees of outstanding citizens is Retired Police Deputy Director General Benjamin Magalong for public service. Magalong was born, raised, educated and still a resident of Baguio. He is joined by ophthalmologist Dr. Joan Balderas and surgeon Dr. Dionisio Claridad.

Mixed Martial Arts World Champion Edward Folayang will serve as guest speaker in this year’s event.

Other prominent achievers are expected to grace the occasion including the reigning Miss International, Kylie Verzosa.

The big event will be kicked off by the ringing of church bells at 6:00 a.m to wake up the residents to join the celebration of Baguio Day.

The event will end with a high mass at the Baguio Cathedral at 5 p.m.
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe celebration is not limited for a day as various activities have been lined up for the whole month of September including “Boxing at the park: Laban sa Pagbabago”, where drug surrenderers, trained in boxing as part of the rehabilitation program, will participate.

On September 3, the city will also mark Victory Day. Mayor Mauricio Domogan described the event as the day Japanese Imperial Army General Tomoyoki Yamashita signed his surrender documents in Baguio, inside the US Ambassador’s house in John Hay, which marked a victory for the entire country and the end of World War II.
