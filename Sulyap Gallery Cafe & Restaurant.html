<font face= "Bookman Old Style" color=SKYBLUE size=5><p ALIGN=JUSTIFY> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Named after the Filpino term for “peek,” Sulyap offers a glimpse of the past through history, culture and art. This al fresco cafe, bed and breakfast and museum follows the architectural style of colonial era Philippines and serves hearty Filipino food. Be sure to try the kulawo, a Southern Tagalog specialty made of grilled and smoked talong (eggplant) with coconut milk.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Located in the former ancestral home of the Reyeses, this was transformed into a cultural tourism site. Structures are built in the tradition of circa 1800s Spanish-Philippine history, with plenty of wooden furniture, antiques on display and lovely details around the restaurant.
