everyone’s family has a Chinese restaurant they always go to. In Baguio, that restaurant would be Rose Bowl. Rose Bowl is 
home-grown and started out as “Rice Bowl” back in 1945. Patatim is the dish we think best represents the restaurant. This 
hearty dish comes with lean meat in brown soup with a side of kangkung that's perfect for sharing with family.
