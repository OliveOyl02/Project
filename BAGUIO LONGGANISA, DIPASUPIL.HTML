<font face= "Bookman Old Style" color=white size=5><p ALIGN=JUSTIFY> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspWhen it comes to 
longganisa, Baguio has gotten quite the reputation. It has a rich history that dates back to the ‘40s marked by the discovery of
 its own native longganisa, the Baguio Longganisa. This original longganisa is called Dipasupil which is named after its founders,
 and has been the go-to recommendation for many locals and celebrities.
The meat could be found at the Public Market. The founders perfected its recipe for the garlicky de recado and the sweet hamonado 
variant. It’s also good to note that it's only made of pork and spices with no preservatives added.
