One of the highest mountain in Luzon, You will be seeing the sea of clouds and you will also experience the cold weather. Mount Pulag is not recommended for beginner hikers, because of its difficulty, you first need to have a health certificate in order for you to take the trail. Well, you can choose a trail when you are at the registration area. You need to have 3 layers of clothes for your protection and of course sleeping bag and tent. After hours of trek you can take a rest at on top of the mountain and wait for the right time to see the beautiful sea of clouds.
