<BR> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe
collective name of several Austronesian ethnic groups in the Philippines, who inhabit the mountains of Luzon. These 
highland peoples inhabit all the six provinces of the Cordillera Administrative Region: Abra, Apayao, Benguet, Ifugao, 
and Mountain Province, as well as the adjacent province of Nueva Vizcaya. Their culture is well-preserved because they 
have defended their land against the Spaniards who already captured the places in the low lands such as Manila and other.
 These people from the cordillera never gave up in defending their land, having done so for 333 years.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe word "Igorot" is an exonym, derived from the Austronesian term for "mountain people" (formed from the prefix i-, "dweller of" and golot, "mountain range"). During the Spanish colonial era, the term was variously recorded as Igolot, Ygolot, and Igorrote, following Spanish orthography.
The endonyms Ifugao or Ipugao (also meaning "mountain people") are used more frequently within the Igorots themselves, as igorot is viewed by some as slightly pejorative,[3]except by the Ibaloys.
The Igorots may be roughly divided into two general subgroups: the larger group lives in the south, central and western areas, and is very adept at rice-terrace farming; the smaller group lives in the east and north. Prior to Spanish colonisation of the islands, the peoples now included under the term did not consider themselves as belonging to a single, cohesive ethnic group.
They may be further subdivided into five ethnolinguistic groups: the Bontoc, Ibaloi, Isnag (or Isneg/Apayao), Kalinga, and the Kankanaey.
