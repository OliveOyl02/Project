<font face= "Bookman Old Style" color=white size=5><p ALIGN=JUSTIFY> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspMen and women debate on an issue while doing grapevine steps and chanting. It could also be an alternate expression of their feelings of love to entertain others and at the same time enjoy dancing. Here, males knit their hands together on their shoulders to form a semi-circle. Another semi-circle behind the males is formed by the female dancers but their hands knit together at their backs.
A lead man starts the chant then chorused by the rest as they move in grapevine steps and bodies bending in a circular direction. The lead woman responds through a chant and chorused by the others as they also do the grapevine steps, moving in a circular direction.
