<font face= "Bookman Old Style" color=SKYBLUE size=5><p ALIGN=JUSTIFY> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp This beautifully landscaped pottery garden and restaurant is a hidden gem in Tiaong, Quezon. Renowned pottery artist Augusto “Ugu” Bigyan opened up his home and garden to the public as an art gallery, workshop studio, and reservations-only restaurant.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Here, guests can enjoy Asian fusion cuisine in the garden restaurant. All meals come as a surprise because there’s no fixed menu and meals are prepared based on whatever is available in the market that day using only the freshest ingredients. While you’re there, check out or buy a few of the unique hand-crafted pottery pieces in Ugus’ gallery and shop. A little tip: Every year, on August 6, all the ceramic collections are on sale with discounts based on the artist’s age!
