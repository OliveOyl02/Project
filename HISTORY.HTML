<font face= "Comic Sans MS" color=white size=5><p align=justify>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe beautiful City of
 Baguio, also known as the Summer Capital of the Philippines, was just one of the 31 tiny settlements, or rancherias,
 established at around 1846 by the early Spanish colonizers in the pine-covered highlands of the Benguet province. Back 
then, the rancheria that would eventually become Baguio City was called Kafagway, a village inhabited by the Kankana-ey 
and Ibaloi tribes of the Cordilleras. Rising around 5,000 feet or 1,524 meters above sea level, Kafagway and the rest of
 the Benguet province was perfect for growing arabica coffee, as the Spanish settlers discovered. The coffee trees, 
however, would outlast the Spanish colonizers for elsewhere in the world, something else was brewing that would change 
the destiny of Kafagway.

<font face= "Comic Sans MS" color=white size=5><p align=justify>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspIn the international 
arena, the United States of America won the war against Spain, and Spain sold the Philippines to the Americans for $20
 million. By the early 1900s, the cool climate of the highlands as well as its rich gold ore deposits quickly attracted 
the Americans. The new colonizers began the construction of Kennon Road that would link the highlands to Pangasinan, to 
La Union and to the other lowland provinces.

<font face= "Comic Sans MS" color=white size=5><p align=justify>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspSoon after, the 
highlands were developed as mining camps and as a retreat for the U.S. Armed Forces. In 1903, the Americans built Camp 
John Hay as a rest and recreational facility for US servicemen. At the same time, Americans mined the mountains in 
Benguet for gold. Kennon Road alone was lined with several mining camps. The American architect and urban planner 
Daniel H. Burnham designed the city. The city got its name, however, from bag-iw meaning “moss” in Ibaloi – the native 
tongue of the Benguet province. On September 1, 1909, the Americans declared Baguio a chartered city and the Summer 
Capital of the Philippines. During the American Occupation, quite a few Baguio natives acquired a taste for country 
songs, cowboy hats and boots. They also gained a command of the English language. Baguio City, in many ways, became 
westernized under American rule, and even resembled an idyllic American town.

<font face= "Comic Sans MS" color=white size=5><p align=justify>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThis idyll, however, 
was shattered by war once again. Baguio City fell into the hands of a foreign power for a third time as the Philippines
 got drawn into the war between the United States of America and Japan. Japan bombed the city of Baguio on December 8, 
1941 and invaded Camp John Hay 19 days later, turning it into their command post. During the early stages of the war,
 Japan successfully conquered many territories in the Far East. The Americans later recovered, however, and even gained 
the upper hand. Soon the Japanese imperial army was on the run. Japanese forces from all over Asia retreated to Baguio
 for their final stand. It was rumored that the retreating Japanese forces took with them the riches from the many
 countries they plundered. Then, upon the orders of Emperor Hirohito, on September 3, 1945, General Yamashita formally
 surrendered to the Americans in Camp John Hay. No treasure was ever recovered from the Japanese, and an urban legend 
was born: the fabled Yamashita Treasure. The legend has grown with the passing of time, and so has the alleged treasure. 
Numerous rumors of crates filled with gold bars and jewel-encrusted golden buddhas buried here and there have kept hordes
 of treasure hunters searching and digging all over Baguio and Benguet. But it was something less incredible and less
 dramatic than Yamashita’s Treasure that began to draw more people to Baguio.

<font face= "Comic Sans MS" color=white size=5><p align=justify>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspShortly after the war,
 Baguio reestablished itself as a favorite tourist spot of the Philippines. War-damaged buildings were repaired and more 
were constructed. Moreover, with the improvement of roads and other infrastructures, the city also established itself as
 the cultural and learning center of the north. Baguio became a melting pot as migrants from Kalinga, Apayao, Mountain
 Province, Abra and Ifugao as well as from the lowlands were drawn by the rapid urbanization of the city. It was this
 development coupled with Baguio City’s natural, cultural, historical and scenic attractions that made Baguio a top travel
 destination for honeymooners, families on vacation, executives on business conventions and conferences and Philippine 
showbiz celebrities.
