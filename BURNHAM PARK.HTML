<BR> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspBurnham Park was
 envisioned by American architect Daniel Hudson Burnham[2] as part of a larger plan for the city of Baguio in 1905. Burnham worked 
with William E. Parsons in coming up with plans for the city of Baguio, as well as the capital city of Manila. The area where 
Burnham Park is situated was formerly known as 'Baguio Meadow". Burnham's role in establishing the park is acknowledged through 
a bust bearing his likeness and a plaque located at one end of the park. The park's design is influenced from the City Beautiful
 movement; It has a small pond or lagoon situated at the green space's center and has and has regimented rows of grass and sidewalk.
 According to the Baguio Heritage Foundation in 2014, only the open field often used for football and the Melvin Jones Grandstand
 adhere to Burnham's original design for the park.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspBurnham Park's title belongs to the Department of Tourism while Baguio's City Environment 
and Parks Management Office (CEPMO) is responsible for the maintenance and operation of the park. The rules and regulations of the 
park is stated in Administrative Order 21 of 2015 which includes provisions against smoking and drinking alcoholic beverages 
well as selling services (including massage, manicure, pedicure, and tattooing) within the park. 
The city government of Baguio has been in charge of the administration, maintenance, and management of the park since February 10,
 1995 when Executive Order No. 244 issued by President Fidel Ramos transferred the responsibilities in operating the park to the
 Baguio local government from the Philippine Tourism Authority (PTA). Through Executive Order No. 695 by President Gloria Macapagal 
Arroyo the Baguio local government was given full control to Burnham Park in January 10, 2008 by transferring PTA's power of control
 and further development of the park to the city government.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp The area occupied by Burnham Park was reserved for park purposes on August 6, 1925 through
 Proclamation No. 64[10] of Governor General Leonard Wood.[11] A portion of the park was separated from the Burnham Park Reserves 
for the purpose of hosting a public high school (Baguio City National High School) through Proclamation No. 401 issued by President
 Elpidio Quirino on June 27, 1953.[12]
The park was first ceded to the PTA from the Baguio city government through Presidential Decree No. 1762 issued by Ferdinand Marcos
 on January 6, 1981 and Proclamation No. 2144 on December 9, 1981 also by Marcos for "tourism development purposes". For five years
the park was ran by the National Parks Development Committee (NPDC) from the March 10, 1989 to March 10, 1994 following a signing of
 a memorandum of agreement between NPDC and the PTA. After that period the administration of the park was reverted to the PTA before
 it was transferred to the Baguio city government in 1995. 
Bills has been filed in the Philippine House of Representatives to revert the park's control back to the national government 
declare Burnham Park as a national park but none has been passed as of 2018.
