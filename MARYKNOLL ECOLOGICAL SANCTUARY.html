 &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspAfter the 1990 
earthquake that hit Baguio City, the Maryknoll Sisters decided on an alternative way to use their resources in the City of Pines
 and converted their elementary school as a venue for education still, but this time to focus on the fragile environment that is 
the planet Earth. Thus they created a serene environment where folks can go on a peaceful stroll, a secret garden of sorts that 
offers peace and serenity in the middle of a bustling city. The Maryknoll Ecological Sanctuary is exactly what 
its name offers, a quiet  haven of greenery providing a respite from modernization,a place where folks can enjoy nature.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspA great place for picnics, quiet getogethers and even team building activities, everyone is
 welcome to come and enjoy the Sanctuary. As one enters the former school building one will notice that one of the classrooms
 have been converted to a store that sells eco-products like stationery, posters,.postcards and paintings while another 
now serves as a cafe. To get to the gardens, one decends stone steps to enter a whole new world of inner discovery. The Maryknoll Ecological Sanctuary is a welcome addition to the parks and gardens and other attractions of Baguio City.
