It was first danced in the olden days when people journeyed in search for wild animals in the woods. The dancers follow one another to form a single line. Later, the pakawkaw is performed to start a ritual to call for good spirits and then performed after a ritual to rive bad spirits.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspIt is played by striking the pakawkaw in one’s hand to produce music. In some municipalities like Paracelis, the pakawkaw is now made by sets to complete tenor, bass and soprano. In Paracelis, it is referred as papiw, abiw or balimbing. In other places is termed liplipak
