<font face= "COMIC SANS MS" color=WHITE size=5><p ALIGN=JUSTIFY> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Just besides the Burnham park stands the humble Our Lady of Lourdes Parish Church. This newly reconstructed Church is one of the favorite wedding venues of Baguio residents, since it is near to the town proper not as congested as the Baguio Cathedral.
