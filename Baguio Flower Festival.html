<font face= "Comic Sans MS" color=white size=5><p ALIGN=JUSTIFY> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspOne of the reasons that people go to Baguio is to watch the Baguio Flower Festival. Because of the cool climate in Baguio and the rich topsoil, there are a lot of flowers that grow here that would normally not last a day in Manila. During the Baguio Flower Festival, a parade is held along Session Road of the most beautiful and uncommon flowers which are uniquely designed and placed on mini stages. The fragrance of the flowers as they pass by is heavenly and visitors line the street snapping pictures of the parade. The Baguio Flower Festival is an event of its own and one of the reasons that tourists visit Baguio. The Baguio Flower Festival began in 1995 when the then Director of Camp John Hay spearheaded the project and solicited the support of the different sectors of the community.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspTo watch the Baguio Flower Festival will not cost anything and it’s loads of fun. The community comes alive with dances, colorful outfits and the participants spend days preparing their designs. The goal of the Baguio Flower Festival is to increase awareness on the need to preserve the environment.
