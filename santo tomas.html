These PIA students agreed to visit ” Cafe in the Sky”located in Santo Tomas or as the Foreign English students call “Mickey Mouse Mountain”. The cool and fresh breeze gives an amazing relaxation and a sigh of relief, it is a great break for students from their busy schedule as University students.
The famous tourist spot where people can visit by car is Santo Tomas; if you prefer hiking then you can follow a trail to reach the top of the mountain. You can see a 360 view of Baguio City on Top. It is also commonly known as “Radar” for locals because of the satellite located on top. But, unfortunately, the place is currently close because of some cleanliness issue that was made by tourists. So if you will be visiting any mountains near or in Baguio City, you should always keep cleanliness in mind.
