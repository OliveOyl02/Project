<font face= "Comic Sans MS" color=WHITE size=5><p ALIGN=JUSTIFY> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspReal honey 
is difficult to come by, but if you know where to buy them in Baguio, then you are in for a real treat. Avoid buying honey 
from the random ambulant vendors that roam the markets, or else you might take home honey packed with additives that don’t 
really help the taste. Just to be safe, buy from reputable stores such as the Mountain Grown Cooperative Store at Porta Vaga 
Skyzone, Cathedral level.
