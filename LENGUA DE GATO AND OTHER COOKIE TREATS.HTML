literally means “cat’s tongue” in Spanish, and since these cookies are shaped like a cat’s tongue, they are named so. They are 
simple yet delicious butter cookies which are always available and in abundance at Baguio’s public markets. There are some brands 
that are more famous than others, but the important part is that you choose the jars with the least crushed cookies in them. 
Lengua de Gato, as good as they taste, are very brittle, unless you prefer them smaller.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspIf you prefer cookies that give you a fuller bite, try the chocolate crinkles, or better yet, some Alfajor cookies, which 
are lemon butter cookies with caramel filling. Crinkles are widely available at the public market, but only Good Shepherd makes
 Alfajors.
