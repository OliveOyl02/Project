<font face= "Comic Sans MS" color=WHITE size=5><p ALIGN=JUSTIFY> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspTakik is a wedding dance identified with the Aplais of western Mountain Province. There are six players to complete the set, each producing a certain beating to produce harmony. The striking of the solibao (ethnic drum) is the guide of the players. The drummer squats and strikes the solibao alternately with his left and right hand.

 &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspA male dancer starts and one or more ladies dance to pair the male dancer moving in a circular motion. Next to the dancer is the sunub. The sound of the sunub is so distinct that it responds to the solibao, the first gong (pingsan), then the iron clasping to produce the harmonized music. The complete set for a good takik music is composed of at least five or seven instruments: solibao, sunub, pingsan, pindua, and the takik.
