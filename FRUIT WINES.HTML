are buying pasalubong for someone who’s had their fill of Baguio’s sweet delicacies, maybe fruit wines are a good alternative.
 In Baguio, you can buy strawberry wine and Bignay wine. There are stalls at the public market that sell local wines, while 
specialty shops such as Vincent’s Place on Loakan Road carry exotic wines made from rambutan, guava, guyabano, and coffee!
