<font face= "Comic Sans MS" color=WHITE size=5><p ALIGN=JUSTIFY> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspDon’t get turned 
off by just hearing the name. Sundot kulangot is actually a dessert made from coconut milk, glutinous rice, and brown sugar. The 
name comes from the way you would eat the dessert; since the kalamay or the sticky sweet dessert made from glutinous rice and 
coconut milk, is placed inside small wooden orbs, the only way to eat them would be to use your finger or a small spoon.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe name itself is intriguing, but so is its packaging—imagine seeing this delicacy
 in Baguio’s public markets, and see if you could stop yourself from buying a pair or more to bring home.
