<font face= "Comic Sans MS" color=WHITE size=5><p ALIGN=JUSTIFY> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe next best 
thing to fresh strawberries is strawberry jam or preserve. If you prefer your strawberries cooked, mashed, and concocted into
 this wonderfully sweet, pulpy goodness, get the strawberry jam. However, if you want your strawberries whole, buy the strawberry 
preserve. A note though: since preserves have whole strawberries in them, they are generally pricier than the bottled jams.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThere are different types and brands of jams and preserves, but the most popular brand of 
jam is Good Shepherd Convent. You can get one at the convent and at the public market, where some stalls have 
them available.
