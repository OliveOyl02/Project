The mountain was named Kalugong because of its rock formations on top of the mountain. “kalugong” is an Ilocano word that if translated in English “Cap”, locals believe that the mountain looks like a collection of caps. There are people living in Kalugong to preserve the cleanliness of the place and the small Nipa Huts representing the different tribes of the Cordilleran’s. Kalugong has a picnic ground suitable for families and friends; you can also have overnight with bonfire in the place with corresponding payment. But the challenging part of the mountain is the rock formation part; you need to be brave enough for you to see the astounding view of La Trinidad, Benguet.
