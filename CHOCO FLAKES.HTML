<font face= "Comic Sans MS" color=white size=5><p ALIGN=JUSTIFY> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspOne of the 
first companies to make and sell chocolate covered corn flakes in Baguio is Mika’san. To this day, it is still the brand preferred 
by many. They have a milk chocolate version and a white chocolate version of choco flakes, and both are equally good and decadent.
<br>
 &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspIf you don’t want to line up in Mikasan’s shop with the rest of the crowd craving for it, their choco flakes are also made
available at Baguio’s public markets and pasalubong centers.
