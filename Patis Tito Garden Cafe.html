<font face= "Bookman Old Style" color=SKYBLUE size=5><p ALIGN=JUSTIFY> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Formerly known as Kusina Salud, this Bohemian cafe serves slow-cooked Filipino favorites using fresh and locally sourced ingredients within a secluded garden hideaway. The cafe was established in April 2011 by renowned designer Patis Pamintuan Tesoro and businessman Tito Tesoro, as a place for people to get reacquainted with Philippine heritage through food, nature, art, and architecture. Materials in the restaurant are all made from reclaimed and recycled materials, giving a twist to the typical Filipino home.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp For those who like to take road trips with their dogs, the cafe is dog-friendly (as long as they are leashed). In fact, Patis has 14 dogs to date, some of whom will cozy up and keep you company during lunch. The cafe recently opened a charming bed and breakfast in a structure decked out in machuca tiles, so guests can enjoy a relaxing overnight stay in the countryside.
