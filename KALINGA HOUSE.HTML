<font face= "Comic Sans MS" color=WHITE size=5><p ALIGN=JUSTIFY> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Province lies at the centre of the Cordillera Region, Northern Luzon, Philippines. The terrain is mountainous with elevations ranging from 400 to 800 meters above sea level. The low-lying eastern side, however, is distinguished by synclines and anticlines.

 &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe Kalinga, also known as the ‘Peacocks of the North’ due to their colorful dress, are composed of three groupings: southern Kalinga, eastern Kalinga, and northern Kalinga. The southern Kalinga cultivate rice in terraces and in swidden, and they have settlement patterns with up to two hundred houses with patches of small villages. The northern Kalinga, engaging in swidden farming, settled in dispersed hamlets of six to thirty houses.

 &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspKalinga have a number of house types, including: forny, buloy, fulong, buyoy, and binalyon or finaryo, which is the distinctive Kalinga octagonal house of the elite. The forms of the houses generally are organic forms responding to environmental imperatives. The binalyon/finaryo type, however, is distinguished by the social ranking of the owners, who are usually pangats the most respected persons in the community. Only ranking families can own such houses.
<BR>
 &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe foundation of the binalyon house is formed by four posts, two girders, and three floor joists. On top of these joists are stringers that run from front to back, and at the end of which, a post is set in the ground. Mortised into the stringers are four sturdy posts, two of which carry a crossbeam that, in turn, carries two queen posts. These queen posts support four purling in the form of a square. Three short ridgepoles draw the rafters together and these are bowed over the purling and fastened below to the upper sills of the outside wall. These fills are supported by eight additional posts.
