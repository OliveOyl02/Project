<font face= "Bookman Old Style" color=SKYBLUE size=5><p ALIGN=JUSTIFY> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThis is a dance common among the tribes in the western parts of Besao (Kinali) who claim the dance originated from the ethnic tribes of Abra. The male dancers with their hands knit together at their backs face the women dancers with their hands knit together at their backs, too. As they all chant, they grapevine to the right then to the left to their original position. As the chorus is chanted, the two groups meet forward to meet at center then back with the chorus. “Hey, donglas di donglalaan dayta, ehem.”
